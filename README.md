# Spring Security Basic App

The Spring Security Basic App is a Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot with basic security features. The app serves as a starting point for building secure web applications, providing user authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to the application securely.

- **Role-based Authorization:** The app implements role-based access control to restrict certain functionalities based on user roles.

- **Password Encryption:** User passwords are stored securely using password encryption techniques.

## Getting Started

To run the Spring Security Basic App on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or later
- Maven or Gradle (for building the project)
- Your preferred database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1. Clone the Spring Security Basic App repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-security-basic-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spring-security-basic-app
   ```

3. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file. Replace the placeholders with your database credentials.

4. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. The Spring Security Basic App should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Register a new user account by providing a valid username, password, and email.

3. Log in with the registered user credentials.

4. Once logged in, you can access the application's secure features and functionalities.

## Configuration

The app's configuration files can be found in the `src/main/resources` directory. Modify these files to adjust the app's behavior to suit your requirements.

- **application.properties:** Contains configuration properties, including database connection settings, server port, etc.

- **WebSecurityConfig.java:** This Java class configures Spring Security for the application. You can customize the security rules and authentication mechanisms in this file.

## Deployment

To deploy the Spring Security Basic App to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the deployment environment with the necessary dependencies (Java, Spring Boot, database, etc.).

2. Build the project using Maven or Gradle.

3. Deploy the built artifact (JAR file or WAR file) to your server or cloud environment.

4. Configure the server settings, environment variables, and database connection accordingly.

5. Start the application in production mode.
